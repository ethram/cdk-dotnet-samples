# AWS CDK and .NET - breakout session demos and deck content

This repository contains slide decks and demo content from breakout sessions at various conferences related to using .NET with the [AWS Cloud Developer Kit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html), as listed below.

## Nordic Infrastructure Conference â€“ NIC 20/20 Vision Session Content

Content from my [breakout session](https://nicconf.com/events/infrastructure-as-code-with-the-aws-cloud-developer-kit/) at the 2020 Nordic Infrastructure Conference, entitled "Infrastructure as Code with the AWS Cloud Developer Kit". The session gave an overview of the CDK and how it works before moving onto several demos showing it in action. The slide deck can be found in **decks/NIC2020 - Infrastructure as Code with the AWS Cloud Developer Kit.pptx**.

Using the .NET Core bindings for the AWS CDK, the demos were used to illustrate how you can use C# in conjunction with the CDK's command line tools to define, create and manage AWS infrastructure, beginning with a simple 'Hello World' example creating and deploying a static website to [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3), followed by further examples using containers, serverless applications and other infrastructure commonly provisioned in the [AWS cloud](https://aws.amazon.com).
